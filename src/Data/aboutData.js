            Hello, this is Trey. To tell you a bit about me, I'm Myaamia Tribe Native American! I have a passion for learning and creating, whether that be learning about the newest tech, about my favorite character in a show or game, or creating applications or designs that are people friendly. I have always been passionate about technology and became a gamer from a very young age. I would spend much of my youth playing video games with my parents. That later evolved in to gaming and spending time with friends. This would be where my passion for technology and collaborative experiences began.

            The earliest parts of my career began in food and housekeeping services. I would later have a 10 year career in the surveillance industry. I gained much from my time in the surveillance industry that I feel can effectively carry over to multiple careers outside of that space. Things such as a keen eye for detail, diligence, communication, collaboration, and various experiences working with hardware and software technology have all contributed to my abilities today.

            Following my time in the surveillance industry I began the pursuit of further education where I attended the Turing School of Software and Design. I first attended Turing's hosted coding sessions for both frontend and backend development. I thoroughly enjoyed the initial backend development session, but was enamored with what I was able to visually create during the frontend session. What started as a small introductory session became a many month long learning and growth experience. I learned a lot about myself during my time with Turing and my love for technology continues to grow.

            Because of these experiences I would be a substantial, dedicated, and loyal asset to any team. I have come a long way with my technical abilities, what I've learned can be found in my "Skills" section of this portfolio. I will always drive myself to continue to learn and grow as my pursuit of knowledge has always been a large part of me.

            When I'm not coding, I am often listening to music, gaming (as previously mentioned), and caring for my animals.
